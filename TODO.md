-	2d_views should select brushes based on proximity to edges, and only
	after that by cycling.


- add mouse warping to 2D views (mouse capture isn't very good for 2D)

- use mouse motion inputs for camera movements to allow low cpu mode

- 2d_view keesps receiving input after mouse leaves (at least scroll input)
